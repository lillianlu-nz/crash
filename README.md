# New Zealand Severe/Fatal Crash Analysis
This app is recreated with sample data downloaded from the Crash Analysis System (CAS) Open Data Portal: https://opendata-nzta.opendata.arcgis.com/, containing 70010 observations in total. It aims to analyse the relationships between different crash characteristics and severe/fatal crashes. 

Any filters applied will change the results in the Crash Locations and Driving Condition tabs. The Severity Prediction tab demonstrates the possibility of predicting severe or fatal crashes by the dataset, under the Bayesian approach. The model performance is to be improved.
